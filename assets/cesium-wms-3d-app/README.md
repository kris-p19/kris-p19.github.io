# Cesium WMS 3D Application

This project demonstrates how to use the Cesium library to display Web Map Service (WMS) layers in a 3D environment. The application is structured similarly to a Google Maps JavaScript API project, making it easier for developers familiar with Google Maps to adapt to Cesium.

## Project Structure

```
cesium-wms-3d-app
├── src
│   ├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the application
│   ├── main.js          # JavaScript file to initialize Cesium and WMS layers
│   └── styles.css       # CSS styles for the application
├── package.json         # npm configuration file
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cesium-wms-3d-app.git
   cd cesium-wms-3d-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   You can use a local server to serve the application. For example, you can use `http-server`:
   ```bash
   npx http-server src
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by your server) to view the application.

## Usage

- The application initializes a Cesium viewer and adds a WMS layer for 3D visualization.
- You can interact with the map, zoom in and out, and explore the 3D terrain.
